    critic: "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, like many childhood favorites, is better left in the past and allowed to reside in memories. As an adaptation of Dahl's story, it's inferior to the Burton remake.",

    autor: "Roger Ebert",
    critic: "Probably the best film of its sort since The Wizard of Oz. It is everything that family movies usually claim to be, but aren't: Delightful, funny, scary, exciting, and, most of all, a genuine work of imagination.",

  {
    autor: "Joe Lipsett",
    critic: "A timeless classic with an all-time performance from Gene Wilder. This film is a marvel: weird, occasionally terrifying and visually wonderful.That chocolate lake looks disgusting, though.",

    autor: "Steven D. Greydanus",
    critic: "Aspires to the whimsy and fantasy of The Wizard of Oz but doesn't really capture the magicâ€¦ more a fond tribute to 'pure imagination' than a triumph of it.",
